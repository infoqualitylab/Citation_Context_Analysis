# Citation_Context_Analysis
Conduct a pilot study to implement a citation context analysis system which: 
- Generate network of citations from "seed" papers in order to understand the relations between scientific research in biomedical domain.  
- Automatically extract citation contexts from the "first generation citing/cited papers" and analyze the contexts to understand what people cited and how they cited.
